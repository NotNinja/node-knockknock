Who's there?  
The module that just called your code.

[KnockKnock](https://github.com/Skelp/knockknock) provides information about the file, function, and package that was
responsible for calling your module.

## Install

``` bash
$ npm install --save knockknock
```

You'll need to have at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4 or newer.

## API

### `knockknock([options])`

Finds all of the available information about the caller asynchronously, returning a `Promise` to retrieve it. The caller
information is provided in a format similar to below:

``` javascript
{
  // The file that called your module
  file: '/path/to/my-example-package/node_modules/example-server/src/start.js',
  // The line number within that file responsible for calling your module
  line: 123,
  // The name of the function within that file responsible for calling your module (or "<anonymous>" where appropriate)
  name: 'startServer',
  // The information for the package containing that file or null if none could be found
  package: {
    // The directory of the package
    directory: '/path/to/my-example-package/node_modules/example-server',
    // The file path of the "main" file for the package or null if it has none
    main: '/path/to/my-example-package/node_modules/example-server/server.js',
    // The name of the package
    name: 'example-server',
    // The version of the package
    version: '3.2.1'
  }
}
```

If no caller can be determined (or all belong to excluded packages), then the `Promise` is resolved with `null`.

The `options` parameter is entirely optional and supports the following:

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                               | Default Value |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `excludes`       | The name(s) of packages whose calls should be ignored. Internal calls from KnockKnock and Node.js are always ignored.                     | `[]`          |
| `filterFiles`    | A function called to filter files based on their path. Only called for files whose containing package (if any) is also included.          | N/A           |
| `filterPackages` | A function called to filter files based on the package to which they belong (if any). Only called if package is not listed in `excludes`. | N/A           |

In most cases you'll want to at least exclude your own package so that your own internal calls are ignored via
`excludes` or `filterPackages`.

``` javascript
const whoIsThere = require('knockknock')

module.exports = function() {
  return whoIsThere({ excludes: 'my-example-package' })
    .then((caller) => {
      if (!caller) {
        console.log('Module was called from unknown source')

        // ...
      } else {
        console.log(`Module was called from file "${caller.file}" in package "${caller.package ? caller.package.name : '<unknown>'}"`)

        // ...
      }
    })
}
```

### `knockknock.sync([options])`

A synchronous alternative to `knockknock([options])`.

``` javascript
const whoIsThere = require('knockknock')

module.exports = function() {
  const caller = whoIsThere.sync({ excludes: 'my-example-package' })

  if (!caller) {
    console.log('Module was called from unknown source')

    // ...
  } else {
    console.log(`Module was called from file "${caller.file}" in package "${caller.package ? caller.package.name : '<unknown>'}"`)

    // ...
  }
}
```

### `knockknock.version`

The current version of KnockKnock.

``` javascript
const whoIsThere = require('knockknock')

whoIsThere.version
=> "0.2.0"
```
